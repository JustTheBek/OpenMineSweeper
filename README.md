# Welcome to OpenMineSweeper!

This is an open source cross-platform implementation of the famous **Minesweeper** game written in C. This is a pure hobby project but aims to reach professional code quality. The game is currently in an early development phase there isn't any working release yet

# Dependencies

The GUI is based on the [GTK-4.0 toolkit](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/) and on the Vector Graphics Library [Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/).

To keep the code portable between different platforms the features of the general-purpose, portable utility library [GLib-2.0](https://docs.gtk.org/glib/) are used in each software component instead of the standard C library features.

For build-process management and build environment generation the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) tool suite was used.
